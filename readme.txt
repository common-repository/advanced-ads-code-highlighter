Highlight code in the textarea field of the plain text ads created by Advanced Ads.

== Description ==

This is an add-on for [Advanced Ads](https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-ads/), the ad management plugin for WordPress.

> 
> Since WordPress 4.9 integrated code highlighting we enabled this automatically in Advanced Ads. The add-on is therefore no longer needed unless you are on a lower WordPress version.
>

After activating the plugin, you will see the code of ads in the plain text and code type highlighted like in any other professional IDE.
See the screenshots for an example.

This is the ideal add-on for people using advanced ad codes with JavaScript, HTML, PHP, or CSS.

This feature is implemented using [CodeMirror](http://codemirror.net/).
